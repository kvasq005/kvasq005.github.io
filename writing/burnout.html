        <h1> Feeling Crispy: Burnout in Grad School </h1>

        <p> I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: academia can be a really shitty place when it comes to your mental health. Yes, your academic adventures can result in a variety of extremely rewarding experiences. There’s no doubt about that. But when your forced to survive this high-stress environment that expects you to juggle heavy workloads, long hours and high expectations on top of the rest of your adult life... Let’s just say that even the most dedicated students can start succumbing to the pressure.

        <p> Therefore, it’s hardly any surprise that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/mar/06/mental-health-academics-growing-problem-pressure-university" target="_blank">mental illness is on the rise in academia</a>. In fact, if you simply google “mental health grad school” you can come up with a plethora of different blogs, comics and news articles talking about this very topic. Interestingly, one of the most common mental health issues on a university campus is also probably one of the most overlooked: burnout. Even as a society, burnout is one of those things that we kind of shrug off. It has become synonymous wiht being "a little more tired" or "unmotivated" than usual--a bad week that can be fixed by taken the weeking off.

        <p> But burnout is much more than one crapy, unproductive week. It's a state of prolonged stress, that if left alone can have negative consequences on both your health and on your psyche.

        <p> It all starts with a couple of negative, cynical thoughts about worth and a dash of head-in-your-hands frustration. It continues with feelings of dread when you hear the sound of your alarm clock because you simply can't stand the thought of heading tow ork and feeling stuck, as you have been for the past few weeks. You feel exhausted, drained, and tired before you even start the day, and you might even have begun manifesting physical problems such as stomach pains and headaches. More than anything, you feel unmotivated or might even be considering just quitting outright because it doens't seem worth it anymore. The enthusiasm you once had for academia is gone, leaving you angry and maybe even on a constant verge of tears.

        <p> Even worse, as this progresses, the amount of work you can get done dwindles. And, in an environment where you are essentially defined by how much work you can manage to get done in a day, you start to panic. You feel anxious. And you begin to skip breaks because you feel almost undeserving of them. And the cycle continues. As you become even more unmotivated, you get even less work done. Yet, you try your hardest to push through the mental exahusting and get some work done. Eventually, if you continue this pattern, your reduced energy combined with your lack of productivity leads you to start locking yourself away from friends and family. After all, they'll just impede on the little work you might manage to get done. Alternatively, you fear they'll be disapointed in you for not being able to handle a few simple tasks.

        <p> According to my research, this is burnout in a nutshell. It's also a completely accurate description of how this whole semester has felt for me. I experienced probably the worst case of burnout that I have ever felt in my life, all because of a nasty combination of unchecked and unmanaged stress, mixed with anxiety, imposter syndrome, and other shenanigans occurring in my personal life.

        <p> I was at the point where I was scared I was falling into a depression. Luckily, at this point in time, that isn't the case.

        <p> But I'm burnt out. I'm beyond crispy. I've essentially become one of those burnt bread crumbs that get stuck in the deep crevices of your toaster. And the most hilarious thing in this whole situation is that the word burnout never even crossed my mind the whole time I was going through this. It took me becoming a sobbing mess at my therapist's office to even remember the burnout existed (mostly because she told me outright, "Krystal, you're burnt out"). Prior to that, I kept telling myself that I'm just in a rough spot. This is a normal part of grad school. If I can just work a little longer or read one more paper or get through the last few weeks fo the semester, maybe I'll figure things out and everything will get better.

        <p> I assure you. These kinds of feelings are not normal.

        <p> And if you're wondering if this is how the next five or so years are going to be, it doesn't have to be this way. Yes, surviving academia can sometimes require sacrifice. Sleepless nights. Putting off all those "adult milestones." Compromising in your relationships. But, as much as we might like to pretend students are workaholic robots, we're not. We're human. With feelings and emotions and an entire life outside of academia. A lifet that doesn't stop just because we have a deadline coming up. So, regardless of the pressure we may have from outside sources, or even from ourselves, we need to remember that burnout can turn into a serious issue. After all, there's a fine line between burnout and depression.

        <p> So what can we do to prevent burnout from getting too out of hand and sliding towards that slippery slope of depression? Well, as usual, I'm working on that myself and as all things related to mental health, some days are hit or miss. But I have been given some hand tips to pass on that I feel are very important. Here's hoping we can all graduate with at least some of the sanity we had coming in.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>Do A Systems Check</span></h3>

        <p> Very early on in the school year, I came across the podcast, <a href="http://www.millennialpodcast.org/" target="_blank">Millennial</a>. It talks about what you’d expect: a millennial navigating their 20s. And, for the record, I’m a huge fan of this podcast and highly recommend it to any one in this age range. But before I start raving about the entire series, one episode in particular has a special place in my heart: Episode 23 – Systems Check.

        <p> The episode starts with a story about a teacher who loved his job. He came in with high hopes and so much passion. But over time he just kept taking on more and more responsibilities--feeling more and more pressure--until he finally couldn't handle it anymore. And one day, despite his love for teaching, he quit. No warning. Nothing. He just walked out and left the job that once brought him so much joy.

        <p> Now, this may seem like a sad episode, but I assure you that it's a beautiful piece that I recommend anyone dealing with burnout to go listen to. But, wthout giving away the ending, one of the take home messages from this episode that has stuck with me si the idea of taking tiem to do a "system check." That is, every few weeks take a moment of self-reflection. ASk yourself, are you're still happy? Is your life balanced? Do you love what you do? And, if you find yoruself saying no to any of these questions, it's time to ask yourself why. What can be changed to keep you right on track? Because the key to keeping a healthy mental state is self-awareness. When you can identify your triggers or low moments, you can more easily do something about them.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>Set Some Strict Boundaries</span></h3>

        <p> Now, this very vague piece of advice is relevant for a lot of things, but I'll focus on two that I think are particularly important. The first is setting a boundary between home and work. Looking back, the moment in which the early onset burnout symptoms started to appear is when my home didn't feel like home anymore. It wasn't a place where I was able to rest and recharge. It was just another place where work (and all the problems came with it) continued to follow me.

        <p> Now, I'm not delirious enough to say that work will never follow you home. That's unrealistic, especially with deadlines and all that. But setting aside some time--at least an hour--for you to unwind before bed is extremely important and creates a temporal separation between your frustrations at work and the comfort of thome; a moment for your brain to switch away from flight or fight mode.

        <p> The second boundary I'm referring to is to set boundaries between your personal and work lives. Essentially, learn to say "no." Because it's easy to say that you'll take on another project or apply to one more fellowship when your advisor asks. And it's easy to say you'll skip out on your hobby today...this week..this month for the sake of getting more work done. But it's important to remember that taking breaks and doing things you enjoy is important too. So keep that balance. Learn to say no.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>Take Advantage of Support Systems</span></h3>

        <p>I mentioned above that I didn’t even realize that what I was dealing with was burnout until I became a sobbing, snotty mess in my therapist’s office. And that was after becoming a sobbing snotty mess on the phone with my mom and an outright brat with my boyfriend. Honestly, I probably made a lot of people worried about me…  Regardless, I feel like a lot of the feelings and emotion I went through could have been partially avoided if I would have reached out for help earlier. I felt that to fix my problem, I had to isolate myself to get more work done and to avoid feeling of judgement from my peers. However, the solution to my problem was in the exact opposite direction.

        <p> When I was feeling stuck on my project, I probably could have talked to my boss sooner. After all, when I finally did talk to him, he helped me feel a little more confident, and pointed me in a direction that helped me better understand what I needed to do next. When I was feeling clueless about the science about my research, I probably could have talked to some senior grad students in my lab. At the very least, they might be able to share stories of when they were in my shoes and how they got out of that funk. And when I was feeling stressed and anxious and like I was drowning in work, I probably could have expressed my concerns to my friends and family earlier (before the sobbing mess state) and gotten a much needed reminder that I have a wonderful support system who will always be proud of me, regardless of what happens with school.

        <p> So, it’s highly recommended that you reach out to those your close too. Don’t just suffer in silence. And, even if you feel that maybe they won’t understand, another option is to make an appointment with a school counselor/therapist. At least in the US, most universities provide at least a few free sessions. Counsellors are truly great resource, yet highly under-appreciated and under-utilized.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>Be Easy on Yourself</span></h3>

        <p> I felt that if I didn’t pass my class or get the results I needed in my research that essentially the world--my world--would end. I have no idea why I think this way, but I feel that this sentiment is not an uncommon one. Maybe, it’s a nasty case of perfectionism or control issues. Maybe it’s just a manifestation of our fear of failure. But will the world really end if you mess up in lab or screw yourself over on a test? It's doubtful.

        <p> Be easy on yourself and now your limits. You can only push yourself so much before you hit your breaking point, and once you're there it's a much harder journey to try and get back to some resemblance of “normal.” So, if it takes a little bit longer to get back in the groove of things, that’s okay. And if you feel you need to take a leave of absence to try and recover, that’s okay too. You know your body and you know what you can handle. The deadlines and to do lists can wait. Besides, just think of how much more you’ll be able to accomplish when you’re functioning at 100%.

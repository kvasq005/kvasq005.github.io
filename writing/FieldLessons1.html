        <h1> Lessons From the Field: Science-ing Across the US </h1>

        <p>Hello my Internet friends! I come to you from the land called Michigan as I'm currently doing some field work with my research lab. It's certainly been an adventure for several reasons. Why?

        <ul>
          <li>This is my first official field experience as a grad student...so everything can be considered at this point</li>
          <li>This field experience required me to drive from Pasadena, CA to Pellston, MI in an 18 foot truck. I've never driven anything larger than your average commuter car. So, the drive was interesting to say the least. </li>
          <li>This is the first time our instrument has ever been out of the field. In fact, we only just got it working three days ago. I'm not looking forward to all the troubleshooting.</li>
          <li>Not only did our brand new, expensive, and heavy instrument have to survive a 3.5 day road trip across the country, but it also had to be carefully hoisted 100+ feet up in the air by some rope and a simple pulley system in order to be placed in its current position, which is in a tower that juts above a forest canopy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Again. Quite an adventure

        <p> But now that we're here, we've been making pretty good progress over the past week with regards to setting up the instrument. It's almost working, and hopefully by the time this is published, we will actually have data! Which I know may sound very boring to the majority of you, but I assure you when you've (literally) shed blood, sweat, and tears for this instrument for months, seeing the data for the first time sounds like heaven. Also, even though we're still setting up everything, I feel like I"ve already gained years of experience. So, I thought that I'd share some of the silly lessons I've learned thus far.

        <h4>Lesson 1: Bugs will forever be your enemy</h4>

        <p> Bugs are gross enough as it is...but I've gotten way too many mosquito bites this week. It's not even funny. Yes, I'm out of the woods so it makes perfect sense that bugs would be an issue. But this is not the environment I grew up in! I've already had to run away from giant flying moths! It's too much to deal with when you're troubleshooting science! Maybe those whose field studies revolve around looking at bugs will have a different opinion than me (I see you, entomologists). But right now they're annoying and need to stop bothering me!

        <h4>Lesson 2: Bad weather is also your enemy</h4>

        <p> Our instrument is currently on a 100 foot metal scaffolding tower above the forest canopy. We're the tallest thing for miles. Sounds harmless enough (unless you're afraid of heights), until the wind picks up and you hear thunder in the distance. Excuse me, I love science but I don't want to get electrocuted for it!

        <p> Also, potential electrocution aside, we're pretty exposed to the elements, especially the wind. It can be so cold in the mornings. Plus, the wind has a tendency to blow things away, which is not something you want happening when you're 100 feet up in the air.

        <h4>Lesson 3: Grow accustom to mysterious cuts and bruises</h4>

        <p> I... I have so many scratches on my hands and bruises on my legs. If you ask me how I got them, I'd tell you that I haven't the slightest clue. Even field work veterans tell me this is completely normal. So, when I said in the introduction that I said earlier that I've bled for this instrument, I wasn't kidding.

        <h4> Lesson 4: Scientists have strange senses of humor </h4>

        <p> The amount of stupid science jokes I've heard this week would last me a lifetime.

        <h4> Lesson 5: Don't get in the way of a scientist and their instrument</h4>

        <p> I keep mentioning the fact I work on top of a 100 foot tower. But I assure you, this factors in a lot! Anyway, because we're on top of a tower, certain safety regulations that are required. One of them is that only a set amount of people can go up the tower at any one time. Unfortunately, when everyone is trying to rush to install their instruments, it means that some groups simply have to wait their turn. And scientists are scary if you get in the way of their data collection!

        <h4> Lesson 6: You probably forgot something back in the lab </h4>

        <p> I thought that when it came time to pack for our field study, we'd be organized and wouldn't forget anything. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out we were missing a very important power cable. Because of course we were. Cue us ringing up our other lab members back at Caltech and pleding them to ship it with next day delivery. (It eventually got here. But that was definitely the set back of the week).

        <h4> Lesson 7: Something will eventually go wrong </h4>

        <p> I mean, this applies to science, in general. But while lifting our very heavy, expensive instrument onto the tower, the switch of one of our components broke! And we didn't have a replacement (see Lesson 6). Turns out that electronics don't work if you can't switch them on. Luckily, I was able to find a workaround and troubleshoot, but panic certainly set in for a second there.

        <h4> Lesson 8: Thinking on your feet is a skill </h4>

        <p> Between the weather, broken parts, forgetting to pack something, and miscommunication issues I've had to remain quite flexible and also become good at thinking on my feet. Also probably also helps that you have a good sense of humor (see Lesson 4).

        <h4> Lesson 9: Everyone is suprisingly helpful <h4>

        <p> Despite all the mishaps and cranky scientists, there's still a lot of camaraderie. At least in my experience, everyone has been willing to help in whatever way they can. Of course, you might owe them a round of drinks at the end of the night. But that's only fair.

        <h1> Lessons from Packing for Field Research </h1>

        <p>So two weekends ago, I had to help a couple lab members get ready for their research field campaign. It was quite a learning experience, if I do say so myself. But it was certainly valuable considering I'll soon be packing for my own field work experience in a few short months. Because I found the experience so humorous and insightful, I thought I’d share the lessons I’ve learned with those who are or are planning to be in disciplines that do a lot of field work.

        <h4>Lesson 1: If it's not bolted down, take it with you</h4>
        <p> Maybe this is specific to my lab, but we have a tendency to build our own instruments since the compounds we study can’t usually be analyzed by commercially available ones. But with awesome engineering comes the ability for things to break. Therefore, every single toolbox, electronics box and potential spare part we could find was packed up and taken (This is not an exaggeration either!).
        <p> I would guess that even if you’re lab doesn’t build their instruments like mine, there are still plenty of things to take in order to collect samples, perform data analysis or just have that rusted spare part that’s been laying on the floor for over a decade...you know, just in case.

        <h4>Lesson 2: Perfect your Tetris Skills</h4>
        <p> If you've decided to follow lesson 1, you've probably quickly realized you have a problem. You're trying to fit an infinite amount of stuff in a finite amount of storage space. Therefore, it's key to hone your Tetris skills in order to make everything fit.
        <p> For me, this looked like arranging and rarranging boxes (and items in said boxes) into impossible configurations until it felt like I defied the laws of physics. If anyone has watched Doctor Who. Just imagine your storage boxes are the equivalent of the TARDIS.

        <h4>Lesson 3: Bubble Wrap Everything</h4>
        <p> New problem. Following lesson 2 means that the fragile objects don't necessarily end up on top of the pile. That's why bubble wrap is your friend. You have a much better chance of finding intact glassware and other breakable items if you wrap them in sheets and sheets of bubble wrap, newspaper from a decade ago, and those packing peanuts that have probably been around since before you were born. It's that or redoing your Tetris magic, which I highly advise against.

        <h4>Lesson 4: Organize the Chaos</h4>
        <p> Okay. Okay. Maybe you can't rely solely on chaotic Tetris-ing. Especially considering that in the field, you only have so much time to prepare before the first sampling/experiment day comes. So, even though you've already shoved every knick knack and doohicky into unlabled boxes which have then been placed into more unlabled boxes, it's probably a good idea to at least designate one of those unlabled boxes as the one that holds the most imporant items. That way, you can unpack it quickly and start performing some nifty science as soon as possible.

        <h4>Lesson 5: Accept that something will be forgotton</h4>
        <p>As much as we hate to admit it, this these four lessons do not constitute a great way to pack for a field study. But it's certainly realistic. And when everythign is unlabled and randomly scattered about, there's always a chance that you've forgotten something important, like a power cord or that very specific, special ordered item that you need to have in order to collect data properly. In this case, you have one of two options: 1) improvise or 2) pester the lab members that have been left back home to the point that they consider screening your emails. As long as they FedEx you the items you need, you can live with them hating you for a few days.

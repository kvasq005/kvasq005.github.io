        <p> Before I entered college, I had absolutely no idea that undergrad research was even a possibility. I thought college would be four years of going to class, joining clubs, and making a desperate attempt at being social. However, once I discovered this whole other aspect to undergrad, my eyes were then opened to a whole new array of endless opportunity! In fact, I probably wouldn’t be where I am today if I had never participated in undergrad research! To those of you who have many questions but few answers to the mysteries of undergrad research, I hope this post can be the guide that I wish I had when I was in your shoes.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>General Questions</span></h3>
        <h4> What is undergrad research?</h4>
        <p> According to the <a href="https://www.cur.org/" tareget="_blank">Council of Undergraduate Research</a>, undergraduate research is “an inquiry or investigation conducted by an undergraduate that makes an original or creative contribution to the discipline.” In other words, undergraduate students perform hands-on work (under the guidance of a faculty member) in order to explore a topic in their field with the goal of uncovering something new that contributes to the knowledge of their discipline.

        <h4> What are the benefits?</h4>
        <p> There are many benefits to participating in undergraduate research! For one, a research experience allows an undergrad to think deeply and critically about the knowledge they come across in their classes. They learn where this knowledge comes from and what work goes into making the discoveries they eventually read about in their textbooks. Additionally, through a deeper exposure to their field through research, students have the opportunity to discover if they're interested enough in a topic to pursue it as a career choice. Lastly, an undergrad that chooses to they gain the opportunity to get to know faculty outside of the classroom which is fantastic for networking in the future.

        <h4> Do I have to research in my major?</h4>
        <p> Not at all! In fact, I was a chemistry major and ended up doing undergrad research in both the bioengineering department and the environmental science department! In most schools, as long as you can find a faculty that is willing to work with you, there should be no problem!

        <h4> Do I have to be an upperclassmen?</h4>
        <p> Of course not! Though most people start looking for research opportunities during their 3rd year of university, I have met plenty of people who started earlier. In fact, I began my first undergrad research opportunity towards the end of my 1st year! While some faculty members may require you take a specific class before joining their particular research group, in general if they think you're a good fit for the lab, they shouldn't have a problem considering you for the position.

        <h4> Do I need to come up with my own research project?</h4>
        <p> If you can, that’s fantastic but you're under no obligation to. Even graduate students have troubles thinking up their own research ideas! In my experience, undergrad research begins by either continuing a project that had been started by a former (graduate) student, helping a current student complete their project, or tackling a research question that the professor already had in mind.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>Finding Opportunities</span></h3>
        <h4> Talk to your professors</h4>
        <p> This is probably the easiest and most direct way to find research opportunities. After all, it is a professor you will eventually be working with. Unfortunately, this is also the most nerve-wracking method. There are usually two ways that students go about talking to their professor:
        <ol>
          <li>Email: A nice email saying that you’re interested in their research and listing some of your qualifications is a nice and simple way to reach out to a professor. Unfortunately, a lot of professors have a tendency to overlook these types of emails or ignore them completely! So, this may be a hit or miss.</li>
          <li>Office Hours: If you're taking a class with a professor you're interested in working with, there is always the opportunity to get to know them better through office hours (and by extension, allow them to get to know you). Just be sure not to slack of in their classes or get poor grades. The probability of getting a yes usually is proportional to your overall ability to do well in their class.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        <h4> Check your department's website</h4>
        <p> Another method you can try is to check your department's website. Most schools have an “undergraduate” section that might list research opportunities on-campus, as well as affiliated programs that offer research off-campus. This may be a little less useful if your school has a tendency to have websites that are hard to navigate or don’t update their information frequently, so your mileage may vary.

        <h4> Find your Undergrad Research Department</h4>
        <p> While I'm not sure about smaller schools,larger, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_I_university" target="_blank">R1 Universities</a> tend to have a whole department dedicated to undergraduate research. These departments can be a major asset because their websites tend to list resources that can help you find undergraduate research opportunities and how to fund the projects through research grants and scholarships. If your school has one of these, I would suggest taking full advantage of it!

        <h4> Read your email</h4>
        <p> If a professor has a big project to take on, they may resort to reaching out various departments at your university. These departments will then send out mass emails to the appropriate student mailing lists in order to spread the word. Unfortunately, mass emails are the ones that are most likely to be deleted as spam, so a lot of possible research jobs go unnoticed. Therefore, I always recommend at least skimming every email before you delete it, especially if you’re actively searching for possible research opportunities to participate in.

        <h4> Go to your career center</h4>
        <p> The goal of any school’s career center is to connect students with professional experiences that will improve their resumes/CVs. Therefore, there’s a very good chance that your school’s career center will actively search out undergrad research opportunities and possibly list them somewhere on their website.

        <h4> Apply for summer internships</h4>
        <p> If you can’t find something on campus and all other methods seem to be falling short, I highly recommend applying for summer internships! In fact, regardless of if you have an on-campus research opportunity, you should still apply for summer internships in order to broaden your horizon and create new networking opportunities! One possible place to begin your search for summer research opportunities is <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp" target="_blank"> NSF's Research Experience for Undergraduates search tool</a>.

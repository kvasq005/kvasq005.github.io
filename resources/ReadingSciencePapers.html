        <h1> How to read Science Journal Articles </h1>
        <p> I remember one of the most daunting tasks I had as an undergrad researcher was reading science articles. I often struggled to force myself to sit down and read one. And when I did, I could barely understand what they were trying to tell me! It’s like it went in one ear and out the other... or the sight-seeing equivalent I guess. But practice mamkes perfect and eventually, I got the hang of it! Turns out I just had to find a method that worked for me. Since I’m a visual person, that meant colored pens or annotating apps on my laptop.

        <p> Perhaps my method will work for you? Read on and try it out!

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>1. Decide which medium to use</span></h3>
        <p>For the sake of saving trees, I try to read papers on my tablet or laptop. If I'm on a tablet, I personally enjoy using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xodo.pdf.reader&hl=en" target="_blank">Xodo PDF Reader & Editor App</a>, as I find it easier to highlight and add comments than Adobe. However, sometimes I get sick of staring at screens or, as is more often the case, find myself getting distracted by social media. When that's the case, I find it's more effective to print it out, grab a cup of coffee, and pull out my arsenal of colorful pens.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>2. Choose a color code</span></h3>
        <p> This is the general color code I use for annotating journal articles:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Blue: General or Backgroud Information.</b> For this color, I usually just mark anything that feels pertinent for me to remember or any background information that puts the paper in context. Do they mention anything that explains why they're conducting this research? Do they define any terms or acronyms? All of these fall into the blue category! </li>
          <li><b>Green: Research Objective, Goals, or Main Hypothesis.</b> This is fairly self-explanatory. I mark anything that answers questions like "What information will be present in the paper?" or "What are they investigating?" or "What do they hope to achieve?"</li>
          <li><b>Red: Importance and Knowledge Gaps.</b> Scientist conduct research because there's some knowledge gap in their field that they hope to fill. So, in red I mark sentences that answer questions like "Why is this research important?" or "What were some outstanding questions that existed before this research came along?" However, with new research comes new questions. So with this color I also mark questions that remained unanswered or future directions of the research in question</li>
          <li><b>Purple: Findings and Conclusions.</b> This is another self-explanatory color. What did they find? What are their key results? However, I caution you to not get caught up in the weeds, or else the entire paper might turn purple. Look for big picture conclusions that answer their main questions (conveniently highlighted in green). </li>
          <li><b>Orange: Key methods used.</b> I'll discuss reasons why in the next section, but I usually skip reading the methods section in most papers I end up reading. However, it's still a good idea to mark areas where the authors make references back to the method section. Do they mention a specific instrument or technique? Mark these so that if you need to dive deeper into the paper you know key words to look for. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>3. Markup the paper</span></h3>
        <p> Science papers seem daunting at first, but, as luck would have it, they're conveniently broken down into small sections that you can tackle one oat a time. The trick however, is that these types of papers are rarely meant to be read in order. Here's how I read them.
        <ol>
            <li><b>Read the Abstract</b>. This doesn't have to be an in-depth read. Rather, just see if you can find their main goals, hypotheses, or key results. A good abstract will give a complete summary of the paper. So, by reading this, you'll get an idea of what to expect in later sections.</li>
            <li><b>Move on to the Introduction</b>. This is where my blue pen gets used a lot. Find keky words, definitions, and acronyms that will be used throughout the paper. This is also where the authors will flush out their goals and state what they expect to find based on their experiments. In fact, I suggest that rereading this section until you can successfully mark their objectives and hypthoesis. After all, this will be key in understanding the rest of the paper. This is also a great section to learn about knowledge gaps in the authors' sub-discipline. These are important to know if you're trying to critically discuss a paper with a group or are reviewing it for a class.
            <li><b>Skip the Methods.</b> Unless I'm planning to run a similar experiment or discuss the paper in-depth with colleagues in a journal club type setting, I almost always skip the methods. </li>
            <li><b>Head to the Results/Discussion sections.</b> There are three main things I pay attention to here, 1) the key results they mention that correspond to the main objectives, 2) their discussion on how they're intepreting their results, and 3) figures that they reference throughout the paper. Regarding the figures, I admit that sometimes they feel overwhelming and scary, but they're there for a reason. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words. If I'm really diving into a paper, I like writing notes on the side of each figure that explain or summarize what's being shown. </li>
            <li><b>Last but not least, Conclusions.</b> We've made it to the end. A well-written summarizes the whole paper and explains how the research being described contributes to the field. If you struggled to find these elsewhere in the paper, it's also where their findings are conveniently summed up. The conclusions section also often mentions outstanding questions or uncertainties surrounding the results, which are good things to know, especially if you're using this papers as part of a literature review. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>4. Note the references</span></h3>
        <p> So now you've read the important parts of the paper, but there's one last step: References. If you need more background information, or the paper makes a claim that you're uncertain about, note if they reference previous research and add them to your "to read" list.

        <h3 class="push-down-4"><span>Final Thoughts</span></h3>
        <p> There's no "correct" way to read a paper. This is my way, but your mileage may vary. It's also important to remember that reading science papers is a skill that can be developed with practice. It may take you a long time to get through a paper at first, but I promise over time you'll not only get faster, but also come away with a better understanding!

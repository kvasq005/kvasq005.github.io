        <h1> Grad School Jargon 101 </h1>
          <p> I remember when I was applying to grad school, there was a lot of jargon scattered around the departmental admission pages, like "comps," "candidacy," "assistantship," etc. At the time, I hoped that I'd just figure what they meant as I went along--and I did, sorta. However, it might have made my life a bit easier if I knew what any of these things meant ahead of time, instead of learning it on the fly.

            <p> So, here are some common terms that you'll see as you look through grad school admission websites. It's important to remember that not all of these terms may be applicable to your specific graduate program.
        <hr>

        <h4> <a name="advisor">Advisor</a>  </h4>
          <p> A faculty member that advises students in their research and guides them through the completion of their graduate degree.
        <h4> <a name="assistantship">Assistantship</a> </h4>
          <p>Assistantships allow graduate students perform services in order to receive a stipend or tuition waiver. They are typically categorized as teaching assistantships (TA), research assistantships (RA) or graduate assistantships (GA).
        <h4> Candidacy </h4>
          <p> Candidacy is the final stage student's PhD program. A student becomes a "PhD candidate" (as opposed to a "PhD student") when they have completed their coursework, qualifying examinations, and any additional program requirements.
        <h4> <a name="committee">Committee</a> </h4>
          <p> Faculty members that help to guide students through the completion of their graduation requirements. Committees typically include a <a href="#chair">committee chair</a> and the student's <a href="#advisor">advisor</a>. These faculty members also typically act as the examiners for students' <a href="#qualifying-exam">qualifying exams</a> and/or their <a href="#defense">defenses</a>.
        <h4> <a name="chair">Committee Chair</a> </h4>
          <p> A committee chair is a faculty member that acts as the head of the student's <a href="#comittee">committee</a>. While the chair is typically a student's <a href="#advisor">advisor</a> some programs require the chair to be a separate faculty member that conducts research in the student's subject area.
        <h4> Cumulative Exams </h4>
          <p>See <a href="#qualifying-exam">Qualifying Exams</a>.
        <h4> Comprehensive Exams (comps)</h4>
          <p>See <a href="#qualifying-exam">Qualifying Exams</a>.
        <h4> <a name="defense">Defense</a> </h4>
          <p> A defense is the final, oral examination where students provides a summary of your dissertation and defends the accuracy and significance of their results in front of their <a href="#committee">committee</a>.
        <h4> Dissertation </h4>
          <p> A dissertation, sometimes referred to as a thesis, is a written research report that presents a student's in-depth and original research contribution to their field. A dissertation is typically the final step prior to the completion of a graduate program.
        <h4> Fellowship </h4>
          <p>Fellowships are very similar to merit-based scholarships. They generally provide a <a href="#stipend">stipend</a> so students can cover living expenses. Depending on the award, they may also cover tuition, as well.
        <h4> Graduate Record Exam (GRE) </h4>
          <p> The <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about" target="_blank">Graduate Record Examination</a>, or GRE, is a standardized exam that is typically required for admission to graduate schools. University's may also require <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about" target="_blank">GRE Subject Tests</a>, as well.
        <h4> Preliminary Exams (prelims)</h4>
          <p>See <a href="#qualifying-exam">Qualifying Exams</a>.
        <h4> Postdoctoral Researcher (postdoc)</h4>
          <p>A postdoctoral researcher, or postdoc, is someone who holds a PhD and is conducting research under a faculty member to receive additional training. Postdoc positions are typically temporary.
        <h4> <a name="qualifying-exam">Qualifying Exams (quals)</a> </h4>
          <p> Qualifying exams are written and/or oral exams that are typically administered by the student's <a href="#committee">committee</a> in order to assess whether the student is knowledgeable enough about their chosen field. If the student passes their qualifying exam, they may advance to the dissertation writing stage of their program.
        <h4> Rotations </h4>
          <p> For some programs, first year graduate students are expected to work in 3-6 laboratories for a short period of time before deciding which group they want to join. The structure of the rotations may vary between departments.
        <h4> <a name="stipend">Stipend</a> </h4>
          <p> Money provided to graduate students who are funded through <a href="#assistantship">assistantships</a> or <a href="#fellowship">fellowships</a>. Stipends are meant to cover the student's living expenses, though some may also cover tuition and health insurance.
